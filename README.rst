Fancy CMS-style page editing for Django
=======================================

The idea of fanycpages is to provide some easy inline editing of pages. Another
content management system, you ask? Know it is not! We rather call it a content
enhancement system (CEnS) because it provides a user with a controlled
ability to edit content on a page.
