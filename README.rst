=======================================
Fancy CMS-style page editing for Django
=======================================

.. note: This is a work in progress and part of this project will likely change
    and could potentially break things. Be careful with using it.

The idea of fanycpages is to provide some easy inline editing of pages. Another
content management system, you ask? Know it is not! We rather call it a content
enhancement system (CEnS) because it provides a user with the controlled
ability to edit content on a page.

The way this Django app works is inspired by `django-frontend-admin`_,
`django-content-blocks` and other similar apps. Especially, the use of
template tags to define customisable sections in a Django template is
based on the ideas in the two apps mentioned above.
